Bitsafe needs a fast USB keys. If you have/get
one of these, you should be ok:

Patriot XT - Magnum - Rage
Silicon Power LuxMini 920 
OCZ Rally2 - ATV
Corsair Voyager (rugged!)
Sandisk Extreme
Sandisk Cruzer Contour
Lexar JumpDrive Lightning

For SD cards, you should aim for a Class 6 (40x) at very
least, better a Class 10 (66x).

Raccomanded size: 4GB is gooad, anything over is just wasted.
