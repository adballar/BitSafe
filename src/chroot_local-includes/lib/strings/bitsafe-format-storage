\"It appears that there's already a storage partition on this disk.
After the format, everything you have on the storage partition is going
to be removed from the disk permanently. This includes the bitcoin wallet
and the SSH and GPG private keys, be sure you don't have any bitcoin on
the wallet, and if you do be sure you have a fully functional backup.

Let me put this clear:
YOU _WILL_ LOSE ALL THE BITCOIN STORED IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BAKUP!!!!
