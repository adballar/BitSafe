bitsafe-umount-storage <options>

Umounts the persistent partition storage and closes the luks
mapping, securing it.
Can work both in graphical and terminal mode. The Graphical mode
is enabled by default if the script is launched not interactively
and the display environment variable is defined. You can change
this with option flags.

Options:
        -u      Unmount, but skip unmapping (leave crypted partition uncrypted)
        -g      Forces GUI behavior
        -t      Forces terminal-style behavior
        -q      Suppress all output
        -h      this help
