bitsafe-mount-storage <options>

Mounts the persistent storage partition (if any), requesting the
partition password.
Can work both in graphical and terminal mode. The Graphical mode
is enabled by default if the script is launched not interactively
and the display environment variable is defined. You can change
this with option flags.

Options:
        -m <mountp>     Mounts in a given mountpoint, overriding default
        -g              Forces GUI behavior
        -t              Forces terminal-style behavior
        -q              Suppress all output
        -h              this help

\"Could not decipher the storage partition!
Possibile reasons:
* The partition cration was stopped.
* You powered off or unplugged the drive in a bad moment.
* The USB drive got broken or corrupt.
* Someone or something messed with your USB drive.

If you can't go past this point even after a reboot, then you
probably lost everything you had on the storage partition,
including the bitcoin wallet. Oh snaps! You\'ve got a
backup, don't you?

You can reset the storage with the function Format Storage
in the system menu.\"`"

\"It looks like you don't remember the password.
If you forgot it, there's nothing you can do to recover
your data. If you have a backup, you can wipe the
storage partition and enter a new password.
If you haven\'t a backup... Well, you should have thought
before.

The command to wipe the storage partition is Format Storage,
located in the system menu\"`"

This can have happened due to an improper shutdown. Be
happy, there is a good chance that you'll be able to

I'm leaving the partition uncrypted, the path is %s.
Copy it on some media and hand it over to some nerd who 
knows how to extract data from damaged ext4 file system, 
if you can't do it yourself. Good luck! :)\"`"
